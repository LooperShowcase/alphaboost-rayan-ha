      Back in 2013, BMW joined the battery EVs ranks early with the oddball i3.
      Then, for the next decade, the company all but squandered its lead while
      Tesla showed the way. Fortunately, BMW recently woke up and delivered the
      all-electric i4 sedan and iX crossover. Now the company's getting even
      more serious with the i7, its flagship battery-electric luxury sedan. We
      recently spent time with it in person, so here's our first look. An
      executive lounge and Swarovski crystals The BMW i7 is the all-electric
      version of the new 7-series sedan, and shares its platform with the ICE
      (internal combustion engine) model. As such, the i7 wasn't designed from
      the ground up as a battery EV, but as just another variant within the
      7-series range. This means there's no front trunk (frunk), and the cabin
      floor isn't flat. On the plus side, it's built on the same assembly line
      as its ICE twin, which simplifies production. BMW offers a single i7
      model: the dual motor (AWD) xDrive60, which starts at $119,300 / Â£110,455
      / AU$TBD before incentives. It delivers 536hp (400kW) and 549lb-ft (744Nm)
      of torque, accelerates from 0 to 60mph in 4.5 seconds (0-100km/h in 4.7s),
      and provides a range of 300mi EPA (369mi / 594km WLTP). An M Sport package
      is available in some markets (as a trim level in the UK, as an option in
      the US).
