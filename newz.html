      The BMW iX is a big car for the brand for a number of reasons; it’s the
      first 300-mile electric BMW, it’s the most luxurious and most expensive,
      and it’s the first to debut the brand’s new iDrive 8 infotainment system.
      That last bit is important because iDrive is the means with which drivers
      and passengers interact with the car. For years, iDrive was the benchmark
      infotainment system in the industry but BMW’s competitors began to catch
      up in recent years, some of which even surpassing the current iDrive 7 for
      infotainment supremacy. However, this new iDrive 8 system is trying to put
      BMW back on top and customization is at the forefront of its strategy.
      Multiple Ways To Interact With iDrive 8 In terms of design, the two
      conjoined screens look great, with a curved, floating design that’s both
      minimalist and high-tech. It’s a simple layout that’s easy to interact
      with, especially thanks to its touchscreen and rotary controls. There are
      gesture controls too but, even in their newest iteration, are gimmicky.

    familiar set of digital gauges. To be fair, they’re really not gauges
    anymore but graphical displays that sort of visualize the digital speed
    readout. If the digital speed reading wasn’t there, there’d be no way of
    correctly judging your speed with the graphical speedometer, it’s just not
    precise enough. However, the graphics are crisp and look techy-chic and
    there are loads of customizable options for the screen.
